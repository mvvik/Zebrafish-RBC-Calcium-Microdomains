### Calcium Calculator (CalC) executables, version 6.10.9
Note: Figure 7 code requires these latest executables to run properly.<br>

#### Executable files are:

* **cmac6109x64.exe** - Windows / Intel version

* **cmac6109xM1** - macOs with Apple CPU

* **cmac6109x86** - macOS with Intel CPU

Do **not** directly execute any code in this folder: go directly to Figure folders in the parent repository folder.<br>

**Note to Mac users:** macOS may block CalC execution due to security policy.
If this happens, open Security Settings, scroll down to <code>cmac6109xM1 was blocked to protect your Mac</code>, select <code>Allow Anyway</code>, then run the code once again. 
You may have to go through system pop-ups a few times more (just don't choose <code>move to trash</code>).
Alternatively, you can compile the CalC [source code](https://github.com/mvvik/CalC-simple-buffer) and place the executable in the <code>CALC</code> folder.
